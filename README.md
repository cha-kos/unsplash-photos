# Unsplash Photo Feed

This project is a coding challenge for Barbershop.io, and was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is meant to demonstrate the ability to interact with an external api, along
with React.js skills.

## Running App Locally

To run this application locally simply clone the repository.

From your terminal navigate to the repository folder.

From your terminal within the repository folder, install the dependencies by
running the command

`npm install`

You must then configure your unsplash api key in the file `/services/unsplashExample`.
Directions for acquiring the unsplash api permissions can be found [here](https://unsplash.com/developers). Once you have configured your service credentials, change the `unsplashExample.js` filename to `unsplash.js` and you are
configured and ready to go!

once you have successfully installed the dependencies and configured the unsplash api service, start the local server by running the command

`npm start`
